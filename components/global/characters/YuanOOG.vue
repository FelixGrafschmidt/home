			"Yuan Flaminjo Kjaskar Raskirson" is actually his original name but I used to refer to him as "Vitario Salmoranes Kjaskar
			Raskirson". This was due to growing distance between me and a very dear friend of mine. I readily allowed them to use "Yuan
			Flaminjo" for their LARP character but in the following years, there was some dissonance between them and my group of friends at
			the time. Time passed and we are on good terms again (I hope, I am REALLY bad at keeping in contact) and I decided to switch
			back to the original name. I will use "Vitario Salmoranes" as his pseudoynm though.
