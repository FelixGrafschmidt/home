				The 20 years of my childhood are the only happiness I have ever known.
				<br />
				They took everything from me. One day I was living my life, together with my tribe, the next day I was alone. As alone as a
				still living being can be. You might not understand, if you have never experienced the oneness that comes with the
				Salasandra. There is a harmony in the world for as long as you are with your tribe. But without that, nothing in the world
				seems to be real anymore. All you do is reminisce about the past.
				<br />
				After wallowing in my grief for ten years, after trying again and again to find something new worthwhile in my life, I gave
				up. I accepted the fact that I would most likely never experience joy again. But as soon as that thought had manifested, I
				experienced a new emotion. Rage, uncontrollable anger. It was all consuming. My mind was filled with visions of the pain I
				would inflict upon those who had come to destroy our village. For some time I tried to fight it. Unnecessary violence is a
				human trait, nothing I wanted to have anything to do with.
				<br />
				But as chance would have it, my strides led me to the far western edges of the forest one day. And I recognized him.
				Surrounded by people I had never before seen, there sat one of the beasts who had slaughtered my family. I was blinded by
				rage but also felt an eerie sense of calm. I took an arrow from my quiver, aimed and let loose. He was dead within seconds.
				His companions sprang to their feet, trying to see where the arrow had come from. Wood elves don't usually attack people. As
				long as you don't intrude into our territories, we usually will just ignore you. Usually. But I was far from the usual elf
				at this point. As soon as I saw the arrow enter his eye socket, I turned around and vanished into the forest. The humans had
				no chance of finding me. You will not find a Wood elf in the woods surrounding the Salamander Stones when they don't want to
				be found.
				<br />
				I retreated deep, deep into the woods. I was disgusted with myself. I had taken the life of a living creature, not out of
				necessity, but out of emotion. I was no better than them.
				<br />
				But those thoughts subsided. I had accepted that this would be my way going forward years ago, I just never admitted it to
				myself.
				<br />
				And so I began to prepare to leave the woods I had spent all my life in. To find the murderers, I would have to venture
				outside, into the Svellttal at least but possibly beyond. My preparations were not so much physical but more spiritually in
				nature. I was used to be surrounded by untouched nature. Birds and other animals would come to speak to me from time to
				time. I knew where I would find food or a place to rest, even if I visited an area of the woods I had never been to. From
				what the rare visitor from the outside to our tribe had told us, these aspects would not be present outside of the woods.
				Supposedly there were plains so large you could not see either end. And not only on land. They had told of "oceans", lakes
				that take days to travel across.
				<br />
				I was unable to even imagine all the strange things they talked about, when I was still young. But I also didn't really
				care. I would spend all my life within these forests, so what do I care what the world outside is like? The last elves that
				left the forests became so drunk on power that their hubris destroyed themselves. Any sane elf knew that the outside meant
				only one thing for us: Danger.
				<br />
				But there I was: Fifteen years after I had last spoken to a person who had visited the outside. Standing at the very western
				edge of the forest, gathering all my courage to leave. Even though I knew I could always return when the outside world
				became too much for me, there was still a deep pain within me when I realized that I was about to leave the last of what
				still connected me to the happy memories of my childhood behind. These had been my thoughts on the way there. But at some
				point I realized that the trees surrounding me were not the same trees I had known my entire life. I had to have left the
				forest I knew at some point and had entered a different forest. My first instinct was to flee. Turn around and run back into
				the safety of my ancestral woods. But after some time I realized that while this forest was different from what I was used
				to, there were still animals here that were similar to the ones I knew. Parts of my experience as a Wyldrunner were also
				applicable here and I started to calm down. This was the first part of my journey. I was surrounded by strange new lands but
				I also did not feel like everything around me was completely unknown.

				Soon after, my arrows found their second target. This time I was collected enough to not kill him immediately so I could get
				the information I needed out of him. The names and last known locations of the monsters I was looking for. Humans are quite
				easy to convince if you just lie to them and claim to let them live if they answer your questions.
				<br />
				I was looking for another 32 people at least. Some of them had families (since when do beasts have families?), so there
				might have been more to kill until my thirst for revenge was finally satiated.
				<br />
				And thus my life as a hunter began. Some people think the tasks of a Wyldrunner are the same as those of a hunter. They are
				simply ignorant. A hunter's task is to kill. A Wyldrunner's task is to do their part in keeping the balance between Nurti
				and Zerzal. But this was not what I was doing. There was no one who would bring forth new life for each life I was about to
				take.
			</span>
			<span>
				Now, nearly a century after my journey started, I realize these things. They fill me with sorrow. Though even today I am
				still convinced that there was no other way for me to take. There are seven targets left, five men and two women. They are
				the last descendants of the humans who came to my village and killed my family. I have not entered my ancestral forest in
				all these years. I am tired. I hope I will be able to kill those seven before they have children. I never found joy in
				killing children.
				<br />
				When this is over, I will return to my home. I have no doubt that I will be able to find the location of my tribe's village.
				After I have visited there, I will venture deeper into the woods. There have always been legends, whispers about spots, deep
				within the woods, where our world overlaps with our <i>true</i> home. The dream from which all elves initially came. Maybe I
				will find it, maybe I won't. A hundred years outside have convinced me of one thing: We have no place here anymore. I have
				seen small villages grow into huge cities, I was present when the blackpelts invaded the Svellttal and destroyed the lives
				of many humans living there. I thought the survivors would surely feel the same rage I do, they were human after all and
				thus so much more susceptible to emotions like hatred. And while some humans might have felt that rage, only a few
				generations later, they were all but happy to live next to their conquerors. The world is moving too fast for someone like
				me to keep pace with. The amount of humans living on Dere is growing at an alarming rate, while we are slowly fading away.
				<br />
				It will be nice talking to some wood elves again after all those years. Most of my contacts have been glade elves,
				descendants of the fools who left the forest all those centuries ago. I used to consider them pathetic, but now I am left
				with only pity. They were willing to give up our ways and live next to humans. They don't know the forests the way we do.
				Some of them seem to realize that something is missing in their life, and they are those who visit us from time to time. But
				many of them have grown to be closer to humans than to us.
