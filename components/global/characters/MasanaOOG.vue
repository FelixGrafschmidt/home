			In Eiji Yoshikawa's novel, Masana is Musashi's family name before he leaves his ancestral village of Miyamoto.
			<br />
			Similar to this, the name of his teacher, Nakua Sohot, is an anagram of Takuan Soho, Musashi's teacher in the novel.
			<br />
			Visually I imagine Masana to be more akin to depictions of Musashi's rival Sasaki Kojiro in popular culture.

			Masana was the first character I ever designed to be a DnD character foremost. I did create a TDE sheet for him as well since it
			helps me understand the character better.
			<br />
			With DnD being a pretty much completely new system for me and my only knowledge being that it is more focussed on combat than
			TDE, I started to think about interesting combat characters I wanted to play. I wanted the character to be someone who's easy
			for me to play, so no stereotypical dwarves or something similar.
			<br />
			I don't quite remember what the initial spark of creativity was, but I decided pretty early on that I wanted to play a Samurai.
			Not the brutish, combat-focussed variant, but more of the type of Samurai, who would go on to become a high ranking official at
			some court. Basically the character I would have played had I ever transitioned to (more or less) historical LARP.
			<br />
			Since we would be playing in Aventuria, I was somewhat limited when it comes to designing a Samurai. There was a group of
			knights in Maraskan that were pretty similar to Samurai, but they no longer exist. So I decided that Masana would/could not be
			born to a classical samurai family. Instead I decided to have him meet a descendant of those knights later in life and learn
			from him.
			<br />
			It is well known that Aventuria does not have a region that is similar to Japan, with Maraskan having some of its
			characteristics, but not all. What I could use was the Rur-and-Gror religion though. Since Masana was heavily inspired by Eiji
			Yoshikawa's Musashi, I decided to take up the idea of Dualism. This is what finally led me to decide on a Race for Masana. A
			Half-Elf who initially struggles with the Duality of his nature but learns to embrace it with time.
