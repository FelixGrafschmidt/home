				Ithambar is the first character I ever created and also the character I have played the most. His name was initially the
				name of my first ever character in "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion", given to him by my best friend at the time. Even
				nowadays, I still use the name as my online alias (Ithambar Lethenain).
				<br />
				It has been more than a decade since I last wrote down his story and while the basic content is still the same, it has
				become much more melancholic than it used to be. I played through one of the largest TDE 4.1 campaigns with him and at the
				very end he died an acceptable death. But I just like him too much to never play him again. At the end of the campaign, he
				had become quite mellow, he had come to realize that there are bigger threats, more important tasks than his own thirst for
				revenge. And while this is a very natural transition, given the nature of most PnP-RPGs, I would like to play him in his
				"initial" state again, as described at the end of his story. Nearly finished with his self given task after nearly 100
				years, longing for an end to it all, but still deeply filled with hatred towards humans.
