			The idea to create a character who intentionally abuses the Elvish magic present in Aventuria came about after I had played
			Ithambar for quite some time. By then I had realized that Elves have some very powerful magic but their way of life limits them
			in how they can use it. What intrigued me the most was the "Lied der Lieder" (Song of Songs) which would immobilize all who
			listen to it. Combine this with an accomplice and you have an easy way to pickpocket people. Add to this the Elves' ability for
			music and the idea was born.
			<br />
			I am still not quite sure if Laryllan is a pure Elf or a Half-Elf. The former would mean that he completely broke away from his
			nature and I have to find an event that would lead to this.
			<br />
			Laryllan was initially supposed to be part of a Robin-Hood style group of outcasts, but apart from him and a nameless Half-Orc
			former noble nothing ever came from the idea. I still like the concept, maybe I will pick it up in the future again.
