			My name is Yuan Flaminjo Kjaskar Raskirson, though you most likely know me as "Vitario Salmoranes". Why am I using a pseudonym,
			you ask? Well, that depends who is asking. If I take you for a person who is sympathetic to my cause, I might tell you the
			truth. I might tell you that I was expelled from the Dark Halls of Ghosts in Brabak due to me violating one of their rules.
			Well, maybe more than one. But wouldn't you expect one of the academies most well known for their involvement in the less savory
			parts of the arcane to be more lenient when it comes to unusual areas of research? Well, you would be mistaken. Back to the
			question at hand. If I do not trust you, I will tell you that I have a powerful enemy in Brabak and I am trying to protect me
			and the people around me since I do not know how far his influence stretches.
			<br />
			My only true enemies in Brabak are the authorities though.
			<br />
			As you might be able to tell from my rather unusual name, I am the child of a Thorval man and a Brabakian woman. My mother lived
			in a coastal village some miles from Brabak when it was plundered by Thorval warriors. Even though you might expect a dark part
			of the story at this point, in actuality, my father, who was one of the raiders, fell in love with my mother and stayed behind
			in secret when his Ottajasko left. He managed to protect her and her family and with time she came to be fond of him as well.
			But he knew all the time that his former family, his Ottajasko, would not look kindly upon his actions. And one fateful night, I
			had just been accepted into Brabak's academy, they returned and this time they left no survivors. I was lucky to be in Brabak
			that day, otherwise I could not tell this story today.
			<br />
			I did not know how to handle it at that time. I was happy due to my admittion to the academy but at the same time I was
			heartbroken due to the death of my parents. I just could not handle it and so I decided to ignore their death. When I spoke
			about them in the academy, I acted like they were still alive. Most people did not know the truth and those who did were kind
			enough to play along. Fortunately my parents left me enough money to keep my studies going even though my finances were
			stretched pretty thin.
			<br />
			With time I came to realize that maybe I was wrong. Maybe my parents were not dead. At least not in the real sense of the word.
			As you might know, there is quite some research into magic affecting the dead in Brabak. And where better to find a spell to
			bring my parents back to their original form than there?
			<br />
			I manged to steal their remains from the catacombs and drew pictures of what they used to look like. I knew that there was no
			known spell that would achieve what I wanted but I set my mind on finding it. Going by stories and legends about returning
			people to the world of the living, I assumed I would need as much of their physical remains as possible and a way to bind their
			spirits when they return.
			<br />
			My work was not looked kindly upon the higher ups at the academy. After several warnings they decided that it was in their best
			interest to have me expelled, so that my work would not lead to them being more suspicious than they usually are. Pathetic. Some
			were afraid, some were jealous. Some started to believe in my work and it made them even more afraid.
			<br />
			For some time I was able to continue my research at my home, but the neighbors grew ever more suspicious of me and I managed to
			flee just before they came to get me. I moved into the catacombs, taking with me all the parts of my research. There I stayed
			for severaly years, inching ever closer to the completion of my work. But last year my progress came to a hold. I simlply did
			not know how to advance any further.
			<br />
			And so I decided to finally leave this city behind. I had found a secure and air-tight hiding spot for my parents where I could
			return to as soon as I had found the answers I am looking for.
