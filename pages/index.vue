		<p>Good day dear visitor!</p>
		<p>Welcome to my humble web presence.</p>
		<p>
			For the past few years I have been building small web applications with the primary intent of private use even though they are
			all available to the public. But all the time I always intended to have a proper web presence at some point.
		</p>
		<p>Well, this is it. Please bear with me, I am a developer, not a designer.</p>
